<p>
In SprintCrazy, the evil Dr. Wheelan has created a giant laser to destroy
our beloved hero, Gustav XVI. As Gus, you the player must avoid the laser
and sprint off. Collect coins to score points and gain powerups!
</p>

<p>
While avoiding the evil Dr. Wheelan’s laser from behind,
the player must run and jump past several obstacles and
score points and powerups to defeat the enemies in front.
</p>

<p>
It is a platformer, as well as an endless runner.
</p>

<p>
The game is primarily designed for desktop.
</p>

<p>
The story is meant to be a lighthearted one,
not meant to be taken seriously. Dr. Wheelan unleashes the laser
in a universe generally marked by bright colors and happy tones,
and Gus must run from it, all while slowly seeing his world being
burnt by it.
</p>

<p>
The game will have an 8-bit art style with a vibrant color palette.
The music that will be playing will most likely be upbeat, retro-sounding
tunes with heavy percussion.
The game will have additional sound effects, such as swooshes and
beeps for when the player jumps and collects coins, respectively.                       
</p>

 <p>
The player doesn’t have control of their movement, so the only thing that
they can control is how long they stay in the air while jumping. There will
be a single button (spacebar) for jumping.
The player will be taught the controls with a simple prompt at the beginning
of the game telling them that spacebar causes them to jump.
In order to get better at the game, the player must learn to properly time jumps,
so that they can safely land on oncoming platforms and avoid falling into traps and pits.
The player primarily collects coins, which boosts their score. However, they
can also collect cans of caviar. If they get caviar, then they get invincibility
for 15 seconds, and the player will not have to worry about controlling Gus during this time.
</p>

<p>
I know that this is a relatively simple concept, but I’m planning on building onto it.
These are just baby-steps at the moment.

My name is Anoop Rajeevan. My major is Game Design, and I graduate in 2021.
I have knowledge of programming in C#, and I have experience in using Maya,
Photoshop, and a little bit of Unity. However, I am still nowhere near a master
of any of these things yet. Hopefully, soon enough I get there!

The lecture notes were primarily used as a guide for this project.
The HTML and CSS, as well as the two sketches in the proposal were
both created from scratch. There are three fonts downloaded from Google Fonts:
